## Background

### What is ART?

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a group of medical procedures defined by the WHO to enable conception due to reduced fertility [1](Zegers-Hochschild et al, 2009).
This includes in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT), zygote intra-fallopian transfer, gamete and embryo cryopreservation, oocyte and embryo donation and gestational surrogacy.  
According to this definition, ovulation induction (via medication) and intra-uterine insemination (IUI) are not included as ART, but come under the wider classification of medically assisted reproduction.
Since the first successful IVF birth in 1978, there have been over 8 million ART births and roughly 500,000 annually [2](Fauser 2019).

### Is ART associated with adverse health outcomes?

<include birth defects, immune disorders, cancer, cvd and stroke>

Interest in epigenetic deregulation as a consequence ART has been sparked by reports of higher rates of birth defects after IVF and ICSI, although maternal factors such as age and lifestyle factors also contribute to this [3,4,5](Ericson & Källén 2001; Hansen et al, 2002; Davies et al, 2012).

Similarly, the rates of specific conditions such as cerebral palsy, type-1 diabetes and behavioral disorders are higher in IVF conceived children, but could be attributable to higher rates of multiple births [6](Klemetti et al, 2006).

### Why is ART implicated with epigenetic differences?

A number of studies and meta-analyses have reported higher rates of imprinting disorders for ART as compared to naturally conceived [7-10](Cox et al, 2002; DeBaun et al, 2003; Maher et al, 2003; Cortessis et al, 2018; Uk et al, 2018).
In relatively few studies has the potentially confounding effect of maternal age been taken into account [11-12](Uk et al, 2018; Hattori et al, 2019).

A small study found that children conceived with IVF did not have an elevated prevalence of asthma and allergies (Cetinkaya et al, 2009).
